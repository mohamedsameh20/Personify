# PersonaPrime (Premium Personality Assessment App)

Early scaffold implementing the premium specification outline. Currently includes:
- Core pages: Landing, Assessment, Results, Characters
- Adaptive assessment scaffold with balanced question selection
- Basic scoring engine (placeholder MBTI derivation)
- Character comparison with similarity metric
- Radar chart (canvas) primitive visualization
- Live insights (top 3 traits) during assessment
- Theming toggle (light/dark) and responsive layout

Planned next steps:
1. Populate full premium question bank (120+ selected from 240 pool with metadata)
2. Implement advanced adaptive algorithm & uncertainty-based selection
3. Expand scoring engine: facets, correlations, confidence intervals
4. Replace placeholder MBTI logic with weighted axis computation from mbti-extended.json
5. Add additional characters with full detailed profiles & images
6. Enhance 3D/interactivity (WebGL or library) for radar & heat map
7. Implement PDF report generation & social sharing
8. Add dynamic theming deriving palette from dominant traits
9. Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA) & performance optimization

All data and processing are client-side only. No external services required.
