### Modular Architecture

#### Core Modules
- **PersonalityApp**: Main application controller and screen management
- **StorageManager**: Local data persistence and backup/restore
- **ScoringEngine**: Trait calculation and MBTI conversion
- **CharacterEngine**: Character loading and similarity matching
- **VisualizationEngine**: Chart creation and theme management
- **AssessmentEngine**: Question flow and adaptive testing

#### Data Models
- **Trait System**: Big Five with 6 facets each (30 total dimensions)
- **Question Format**: Structured questions with metadata and targeting
- **Character Profiles**: Fictional characters with normalized trait scores
- **Scoring Rules**: Configurable weights and calculation methods

## 🧠 Personality Model

### Big Five Traits + Extensions
1. **Openness to Experience**
   - Imagination, Artistic Interests, Emotionality
   - Adventurousness, Intellect, Liberalism

2. **Conscientiousness**
   - Self-Efficacy, Orderliness, Dutifulness
   - Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline, Cautiousness

3. **Extraversion**
   - Friendliness, Gregariousness, Assertiveness
   - Activity Level, Excitement Seeking, Cheerfulness

4. **Agreeableness**
   - Trust, Morality, Altruism
   - Cooperation, Modesty, Sympathy

5. **Neuroticism**
   - Anxiety, Anger, Depression
   - Self-Consciousness, Immoderation, Vulnerability

### MBTI Integration
Automatic conversion from Big Five scores to MBTI types:
- **E/I**: Based on Extraversion scores
- **S/N**: Complex calculation using Openness and Conscientiousness
- **T/F**: Based on Agreeableness scores (reversed)
- **J/P**: Based on Conscientiousness scores

### Character Matching Algorithm
Uses weighted Euclidean distance with trait importance factors:
```javascript
similarity = 1 - sqrt(sum(weight_i * (user_trait_i - character_trait_i)²))
```

## 📊 Scoring System

### Response Processing
- **5-Point Likert Scale**: Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5)
- **Reverse Scoring**: Automatic handling of negatively worded items
- **Weighted Aggregation**: Facet scores combine to create trait scores
- **Normalization**: Z-score standardization for population comparison

### Reliability Measures
- **Cronbach's Alpha**: Internal consistency calculation
- **Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap-based uncertainty estimation
- **Adaptive Testing**: Minimize questions while maximizing reliability
- **Consistency Checks**: Detect response patterns and contradictions

### Advanced Analytics
- **Trait Correlations**: Inter-trait relationship analysis
- **Profile Stability**: Confidence measures for each trait
- **Response Patterns**: Detection of careless or biased responding
- **Time Analysis**: Response time validation and quality metrics
